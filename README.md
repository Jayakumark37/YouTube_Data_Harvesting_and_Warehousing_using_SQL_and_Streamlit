## Description

This project aims to create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. The application facilitates the retrieval of various data points such as channel details, video information, playlists, and comments using the YouTube API. It also provides functionality to store this data in a SQL database MySQL and query it for analysis.



## Prerequisites
Before using the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
1. Python Environment: Install Python on your system.
2. Google API Key: Obtain a Google API key from the Google Cloud Console for accessing the YouTube API.
3. Dependencies: Install required Python libraries using requirements.txt.
4. SQL Database: Set up MySQL or PostgreSQL database and configure connection details in the code.
5. Streamlit: Install Streamlit library for running the application.
## Workflow

1. Data Retrieval
2. Data Storage
3. SQL Data Warehouse
4. Data Analysis
5. Streamlit UI

## Required Python Libraries
The following Python libraries are required for the project:
1.google-api-python-client: For interacting with the YouTube API. 
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. mysql-connector-python: For connecting to MySQL database.
4. Streamlit: For building the user interface and web application.
5. datetime: For handling date and time operations.

## You can install these libraries using pip:
--> pip install google-api-python-client pandas streamlit mysql-connector-python
